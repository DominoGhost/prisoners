# Prisoners
Prisoners is a simple program that tells the percentage of winning using a solution from a riddle called the [100 Prisoners Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem).

## How it works
The program runs through the same solution 10,000,000 times and takes the average amount of times that the prisoners have won.

## Installing
